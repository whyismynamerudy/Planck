# Planck
The To-Do/Homework Planner app, Planck.

This application was created to solve an issue faced by a close friend of mine who struggled with managing and prioritizing his time between his extracurriculars and his academics. In the process of developipg this application, I met up with my friend multiple times to extract client requirements, which I used to inform the features of this product. At each stage in development, I consulted my friend, got his feedback, and gave him updates to ensure the product was able to meet his needs.

The MySQL database that was locally created and used during the development of this application is exported and included in this repository for completion.

To see a working version of the app, view the screenshots below:
