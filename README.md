The To-Do/Homework Planner app I created as the final project for my IB CS HL Internal Assessment

This application was created for the purposes of an internal assessment for my high school diploma; as such, it was created in such a way as to adhere to the constraints placed upon those in the diploma programme. 

The MySQL database that was locally created and used during the development of this application is exported and included in this repository for completion - it will not be edited to work with an online database in the near future. 

To see a working version of the app, view the screenshots below:



I had also created a video which showcased the functionality of the application, but I cannot upload the video because it was used as a part of my assessment for this course, and I do not want to risk plagiarism if the video is seen by those currently in this course.
